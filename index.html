  <h1>I am on a quest to learn how to build physical things.</h1>

  <div class="text">
      <p>I have come to believe that working in the digital realm is fun, but it is nowhere near as hard and impactful as what can be done in the physical world.</p>
      <p>Right now I’m making Waffle Bot.</p>
      <p>I make waffles for my partner every morning. Even though all I do is take them out of the freezer, toast them, and cover them in awesome toppings, I am lazy. Waffle Bot will carry them from the toaster to the plate for me.</p>

      Figured out how to wire a DC power supply to give servos more of a boost and found out that I killed 4 HS-311s while building Waffle Bot v1.

      Finished first full version of the WaffleBot, connected it to the Raspberry Pi, and found that the HS-311 servos did not have enough torque / arm was too heavy so they couldn't lift it up properly. Also spent 3.5h in the morning at a contract manufacturer seeing every step of the PCBA process.

      Built v2 of the Waffle Bot base, this time not just a cubic block of PLA with a rough hole in it (lol) but one properly optimized for sturdiness, attachment to the servo and quick 3d printing.

        <li>Got bogged down trying to assemble the servo gripper before realizing the print was missing two parts</li>
        <li>Even after printing those wasn’t able to assemble it, turned out that the stl design was faulty and the holes for screws and hex nuts were size mismatched. Don't trust the internet I guess</li>
