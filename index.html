      Figured out how to wire a DC power supply to give servos more of a boost and found out that I killed 4 HS-311s while building Waffle Bot v1.

      Finished first full version of the WaffleBot, connected it to the Raspberry Pi, and found that the HS-311 servos did not have enough torque / arm was too heavy so they couldn't lift it up properly. Also spent 3.5h in the morning at a contract manufacturer seeing every step of the PCBA process.

      Spent the day researching potentiometers and how to read them with microcontrollers.

      Decided I want to build more physical projects. Digital stuff is fun, but it's nowhere near as hard and impactful as physical things.
